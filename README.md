## Project Title
Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Description
In this project, we will apply the concepts of **Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra** and complete an ETL pipeline using Python.

We will use data provided by **Million Song Dataset**, to create data model about a song and the artist of that song.
As data engineer, we need to create an *Apache Cassandra Database* which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and to create a database for this analysis.

## Project Steps:
* Transfer data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model.
* Insert data into Apache Cassandra tables. 
* Model your data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.

## Files used

### Python Files:
* cassandra_python_etl.py - Create sessions, and schema and also database for analysis. Drop the tables and close session after analysis.
